## 📜 Details
* I used **React, Redux, Saga, SCSS, React-Intl**.
* Tests for complex components and sagas.<br />
* Visual side 🎨:<br />
  ** Responsive design<br />
  ** CSS animations and transitions<br />
  ** Attention to details:<br />
    *** Spinners for fetching the list of expenses, posting comments or uploading files. <br />
    *** Notifications for connectivity issues with proper `alertdialog` ARIA role.<br />
* Semantic and accessibility.<br />
** Cards pattern for expenses (see [implementation](https://github.com/vstanyshevskyy/expenses-app/blob/master/frontend/src/helpers/card-click-helper.js) inspired by [Heydon Pickering](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/))<br />
** The list of expenses is actually `<ul>` with nested - great for SEO and accessibility as well.<br />
* 97-100 scores in Google Lighthouse.<br />

## 🤓 Challenging moments
* I18n

## ⏰ Time spent
* ~22 hours according to git logs.

## 🤔 What I would like to add
* Filtering by currency
* Some gallery/modal for receipt + ability to delete a receipt.
* Drag and drop for receipts upload
* [Web Sharing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) to share expenses

## 🤖 API changes
